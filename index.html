        <h1>Welcome to My Website's Homepage!</h1>

        <h2>A new beginning</h2>
        <p>This is my very first paragraph element! I am very excited to begin my
            coding adventure!
        </p>
        <p>I'm sure there will be difficulties along the way, but that's alright!</p>

        <h2>Things I'd like to do with this website</h2>
        <p>What I'd like to do with this website is get <strong>comfortable with the basics</strong>
            of HTML programming. I am following along with The Odin Project
            and hope to have confidence in my abilities within a few weeks so that
            I can get into new territory.
        </p>
        <p>I have made HTML and CSS documents before while working with 
            FreeCodeCamp, but I wanted to get into more detail and it's been
            a while, so I figured I'd restart my coding journey.
        </p>
        <p>I am actually glad that I have made this decision as I've gotten to 
            use the command line and Git and I've spent a lot of time setting up
            a virtual machine to run Linux. It's all <em>very</em> new and all <em>very</em> exciting.
